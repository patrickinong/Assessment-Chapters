  He has had a thing for Rachel Green for a long time; she is a stylish woman from an affluent background who works as a barista at Central Perk, a caf√© that is a gathering place for the gang.
  <br>
  She eventually gets hired by Ralph Lauren. Phoebe Buffay has an eccentric attitude on life and works as a ditsy masseur and aspiring singer.
  <br>
  Joey Tribbiani, an actor and clown who struggles most of the time, confides in Chandler Bing frequently.
